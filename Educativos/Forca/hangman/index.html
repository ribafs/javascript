<!--
Hangman Script by Jan Mulder.
For help or feedback contact: info@EnglishCafe.co.uk

This script is free. You may use it as-is or modify it to suit your needs.
Please put an acknowledgement to me (see above) somewhere in the head section
of your page source. Some visible acknowledgement, while not necessary, is
customary and would be nice.

This script has been written from the ground up so
DO NOT COPY IT AND PASS IT OFF AS YOUR OWN.
-->

<!--
Below you is the hangman data.

"sourceDir" is the location of the hangman script (and images) relative to this file.
I usually put them in a subfolder called "hangman". You can also place them in the
same folder as this file. "sourceDir" would then be nothing. You will need to
include the line:

var sourceDir = "";

"words" is an array of word pairs used in the game. The first word is the actual
word to guess. The second is an optional hint. This can be a word or phrase.
If you don't want to use hints you just leave this field with an empty string.

For example:

var words = new Array(
 "word1", "",
 "word2", "",
 "word3", ""
);

Notice that the last item in the array is NOT followed by a comma. This is standard
JavaScript and if you put it there it will crash.
-->

<SCRIPT language="JavaScript">
var sourceDir = "hangman/";

var words = new Array(
 "TABLE","Dining room",
 "CHAIR","Goes with table",
 "COOKER","In the kitchen",
 "DISHWASHER","In the kitchen",
 "SINK","For washing",
 "WASHING MACHINE","For your clothes",
 "TELEPHONE","Electronic",
 "RECORD PLAYER","Electronic",
 "TUNER","Part of your HI-FI",
 "AMPLIFIER","Part of your HI FI",
 "COMPUTER","Electronic",
 "BOOKSHELF","In the livingroom",
 "ARMCHAIR","In the livingroom",
 "CARPET","You walk on it",
 "SCANNER","Electronic",
 "TELEVISION","Electronic",
 "IRONING BOARD","For your clothes",
 "RADIATOR","For comfort",
 "BLANKET","Keeps you warm",
 "COFFEE MAKER","For drinks",
 "KETTLE","For drinks",
 "KNIFE","In the kitchen",
 "FORK","In the kitchen",
 "SPOON","In the kitchen",
 "Curtain","For privacy",
 "shower","Keeps you clean",
 "BATH","Nice and warm"
);
</SCRIPT>


<!--
Now we include the script file "hangman.js"
This must be done AFTER the words data has been defined. (see above)
-->
<SCRIPT SRC="hangman/hangman.js"></SCRIPT>

<!--
The rest is straightforward.
Some in the page you must call the following functions:
drawHangman();   - this draws the hangman picture
drawControl();   - this draws the control panel with letters
drawAnswer();    - this draws the answer display
drawHint();      - this draws the hint button and display. (optional)

You can choose the layout and design of your page because you can call the
functions anywhere in the page.
