Command &amp; Conquer - HTML5
=============================

## About

This is a recreation of the original Command and Conquer, Real Time Strategy game entirely in HTML5 and Javascript.

This project is only intended as a technical proof of concept to demonstrate the basic working elements of an RTS game in HTML5. No commercial use is intended. All images and sounds used are from C&C - Tiberian Dawn and are property of the original game creators.

This game works best on Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. The images can take a little while to load so please be patient.
