# [simple-js-editor](https://mat3e.github.io/simple-js-editor/)
I wanted to introduce editable and executable JS code snippets to my [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentations. That's it.

> [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) added, because it is aslo inside [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/).
