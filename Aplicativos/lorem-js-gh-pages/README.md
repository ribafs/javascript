# LoremJS
#### A simple lorem ipsum generator using JavaScript.

[Demo](https://thomashockaday.github.io/lorem-js/)

## How to Use
Download the __lorem.js__ file and add the script reference to the __head__ of your html file:
```html
<script src="lorem.js"></script>
```
Whenever you need some placeholder text, call a new script tag, along with the __lorem__ function and how many words you need. For example - 10:
```html
<script>lorem(10);</script>

```
Would produce something like:
```
Donec sollicitudin, mi in ultrices tincidunt, nisl libero gravida sem.
```
That's it!


## Why?
Because I'm too lazy to Google new placeholder text every time I want some, and wanted to prove that you don't need large plugins or packages to make this work.
