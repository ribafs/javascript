JavaScript Classes

ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.

JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.
JavaScript Class Syntax

Use the keyword class to create a class.

Always add a method named constructor():
Syntax
class ClassName {
  constructor() { ... }
}
Example
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
}

The example above creates a class named "Car".

The class has two initial properties: "name" and "year".

A JavaScript class is not an object.

It is a template for JavaScript objects.
Using a Class

When you have a class, you can use the class to create objects:
Example
let myCar1 = new Car("Ford", 2014);
let myCar2 = new Car("Audi", 2019);

The example above uses the Car class to create two Car objects.

The constructor method is called automatically when a new object is created.
The Constructor Method

The constructor method is a special method:

    It has to have the exact name "constructor"
    It is executed automatically when a new object is created
    It is used to initialize object properties

If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.
Class Methods

Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.

Use the keyword class to create a class.

Always add a constructor() method.

Then add any number of methods.
Syntax
class ClassName {
  constructor() { ... }
  method_1() { ... }
  method_2() { ... }
  method_3() { ... }
}

Create a Class method named "age", that returns the Car age:
Example
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
  age() {
    let date = new Date();
    return date.getFullYear() - this.year;
  }
}

let myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"My car is " + myCar.age() + " years old.";

You can send parameters to Class methods:
Example
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
  age(x) {
    return x - this.year;
  }
}

let date = new Date();
let year = date.getFullYear();

let myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=
"My car is " + myCar.age(year) + " years old.";
