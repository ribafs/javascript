Load Balance multiple RTMP Servers to Horizontally Scale Streaming ( With Node Media Server and HAProxy)

In this video I will show case the new Node Media Server , a Node JS implementation of an RTMP server used for streaming setup. I will show how to install and spinup an RTMP server and stream to it from OBS. Then I will spin up multiple ones, then Iâ€™ll show how to relay the stream to multiple RTMP servers and finally I will use HAProxy to load balance the stream consumption to achieve high availability.
