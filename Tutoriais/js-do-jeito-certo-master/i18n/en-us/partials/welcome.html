<h1>Hey, you!</h1>

<p>
    This is a guide intended to introduce new developers to JavaScript and help experienced developers learn more about its best practices.
</p>

<p>
    Despite the name, this guide doesn't necessarily mean "the only way" to do JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
    We just gather all the articles, tips, and tricks from top developers and put it here. Since it comes from exceptional folks, we could say that it is "the right way", or the best way to do so.
