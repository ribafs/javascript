## Project Structure

All of the Elm code lives in `Main.elm` and relies
on the [elm-html][] package.

[elm-html]: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/latest/

There also is a port handler set up in `index.html` to set the focus on
particular text fields when necessary.

## Build Instructions

You need to install [elm](http://elm-lang.org/install)
on your machine first.

Run the following commands from the root of this project:

```bash
elm make src/Main.elm --output build/elm.js
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser!
